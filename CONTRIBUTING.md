## Setting Up the Development Environment

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/cc-manager.git
cd cc-manager

# 2. Move into the main application directory
cd v1

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Start the development server
npm run dev
```

> **Note:** Node.js 18+ is required. The dev server watches for file changes and recompiles automatically.

## Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests (from the v1/ directory)
npm test

# Integration / end-to-end tests (from the repo root)
bash tests/run_tests.sh
```

TypeScript type-checking can be run separately:

```bash
cd v1
npx tsc
```

All type errors must be resolved before submitting a pull request.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Fork** the repository and create your branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes.** Keep commits focused and atomic.

3. **Commit** with a clear message following the format:
   ```
   feat: add task priority filtering
   fix: handle merge conflict in worktree-pool
   docs: update API reference in README
   ```

4. **Push** your branch and **open a PR** against `main`:
   ```bash
   git push origin feat/your-feature-name
   ```
   Then open a pull request on GitHub with a description of what changed and why.

5. **Address review feedback** by pushing additional commits to the same branch.

## Code Style

- **Language:** All application code is written in **TypeScript**. Do not add plain `.js` source files under `v1/src/`.
- **Imports:** Always use `.js` extensions in import paths, even when importing `.ts` files:
  ```ts
  // correct
  import { Store } from "./store.js";

  // incorrect
  import { Store } from "./store";
  ```
  This is required for Node.js ESM compatibility.
- **Dashboard:** `web/index.html` is a self-contained file with no build step. Do **not** introduce frontend frameworks (React, Vue, etc.) or bundlers. Vanilla JS and inline `<style>` only.
- **Formatting:** Follow the conventions already present in each file — consistent indentation (2 spaces), single quotes for strings, and trailing semicolons.
- **Type safety:** Avoid `any`. Prefer explicit types and extend the interfaces in `types.ts` when adding new shapes.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows a simple standard: **be kind and constructive**.

- Treat all contributors with respect regardless of experience level.
- Provide clear, actionable feedback in code reviews.
- Assume good intent; ask clarifying questions before escalating disagreements.
- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks of any kind will not be tolerated.

If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour, please open a private issue or contact a maintainer directly.
